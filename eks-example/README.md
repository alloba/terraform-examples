# EKS Example Project

This example has a starting point of [This Repo](https://github.com/hashicorp/learn-terraform-provision-eks-cluster)
and largely leans on configuration described there. 

There is a bit of tweaking and fiddling on my end, but not overly much (at time of writing). 

This project creates all the surrounding infrastructure around and EKS instance as well (VPC/Subnets/etc.), 
so just keep that in mind. 

## Update
Honestly as I look at setting up a k8s anything, it just looks so over the top and not like something 
I can care about currently. The terraform files here work exactly as advertised, but the remaining
kubectl config and setting things to up run and junk is omitted. Maybe I'll be back to this one day and 
can pick it back up.
