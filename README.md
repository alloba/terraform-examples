# Terraform Example Collection

This project is a collection of working examples for terraform scripts (for AWS).

My experience with these types of things is that I'm well enough capable of poking at existing 
versions of the thing that I want to get something new and serviceable. 
So, I'm going to make a collection of templates I can work with. 

It'll force me to learn the thing, as well as being useful in the future when I've forgotten everything I've learned.
